# Personal Run Commands Vim and Configuration

This repo includes my personal collection of settings and custom commands.

## Installation

Install it like any other plugin, I recommend using the plugin manager of our
choice. For example `plug.vim` at your `$HOME/.vimrc` add:

```
call plug#begin('~/Projects/rc.vim/plug')
" other plugins...
Plug 'diacus/rc.vim'
" other plugins...
call plug#end()
```

## Getting help

Once installed, you can see the documentation within the vim's help system

```
:help rc.vim
```
